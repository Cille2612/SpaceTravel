# 🚀 SpaceTravel

An interactive web application visualizing the milestones of SpaceX history on an animated timeline. This project was created as an exercise in handling REST APIs and dynamic rendering.

## 📝 Project Description

SpaceTravel is a compact website that fetches historical spaceflight events directly from the official SpaceX database. The goal was to retrieve complex API data and present it in a modern, space-themed design (Space-Art) with a user-friendly interface.

## 🛠 Features

* **Dynamic Timeline**: Events are displayed chronologically in an alternating left-right layout.
* **Space-Art Background**: A pure CSS-animated starry sky with drifting effects.
* **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap 5 to ensure the spaceflight history looks great on any device.
* **Ghost-Button UI**: Transparent interaction elements that complement the visual aesthetic.

## 📡 Data Source

The website utilizes the **SpaceX API** (v3) to ensure up-to-date information:

* **API Endpoint**: [SpaceX History API](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/history)
* **Documentation**: [Official SpaceX API Docs](https://docs.spacexdata.com/#9f1dfdc0-fbe8-4ae5-9209-7f3d649a627c)

> All information about the spaceflight history shown comes from the official SpaceX database.
